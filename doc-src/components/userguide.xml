			The Architecture Description Languages (ADL) are a way to
			describe software and/or system architectures. ADLs
			facilitate application description without concern for the
			underlying implementation code and foster code reuse as an
			effect of decoupling the implementation from the
			architecture. Architectures created by using ADLs are
			composed of predefined entities with various connectors that
			communicate through defined connections. To define an
			architecture through an ADL we can use a textual syntax
			and/or a graphical syntax, possibly associated with a design
			tool.
		</para>
		<para>
			In the case of ProActive we have developed the Grid
			Component Model which is an extension of the Fractal ADL.
			For detailed information on Fractal read

			.


			In our GCM implementation this mechanism is used to
			configure and deploy component systems through normalized
			XML files. Thanks to a specific XML DTD, it specifies a
			definition for each component of the application. For
			instance, it usually describes component interfaces,
			component bindings, component attributes, the subcomponents
			in the case of a composite component, the virtual node where
			the component will be deployed, and so on. As it is an
			extension of the standard Fractal ADL, GCM allows reusing
			and integrating ProActive-specific features such as
			distributed deployment using deployment descriptors, active
			objects, virtual nodes, etc. For example, in the case of
			virtual nodes the components ADL has to be associated with a
			deployment descriptor (this is done at parsing time: both
			files are given to the parser).

		</para>
		<para>
			Note that because GCM is based on the Fractal ADL, it
			requires the following libraries which are included in the
			<literal>/lib</literal>
			directory of the ProActive distribution :
			<literal>fractal-adl.jar</literal>
			,

			<para>
				Components are deployed on the virtual node that is
				specified in their definition ; it has to appear in the
				deployment descriptor
				<emphasis role="underline">unless</emphasis>
				this virtual node is exported. In this case, the name of
				the exported virtual node should appear in the
				deployment descriptor, unless this exported virtual node
				is itself exported.
			</para>
			<para>
				When exported, a virtual node can take part in the
				composition of other exported virtual nodes. The idea is
				to further extend reusability of existing (and packaged,
				packaging being a forthcoming feature of Fractal)
				components.
			</para>
			<para>
				In the example, the component defined in
				helloworld-distributed-wrappers.fractal exports the
				virtual nodes VN1 and VN2:
			</para>
			<screen>
				exportedVirtualNodes exportedVirtualNode name='VN1'
				composedFrom composingVirtualNode component='client'
				name='client-node' /composedFrom /exportedVirtualNode
				exportedVirtualNode name='VN2' composedFrom
				composingVirtualNode component='server'
				name='server-node'/ /composedFrom /exportedVirtualNode
				/exportedVirtualNodes
			</screen>
			<para>
				VN1 is composed of the exported virtual node
				'client-node' from the component named client
			</para>
			<para>
				In the definition of the client component
				(ClientImpl.fractal), we can see that client-node is an
				exportation of a virtual node which is also name
				'client-node':
			</para>
			<screen>
				exportedVirtualNodes exportedVirtualNode
				name='client-node' composedFrom composingVirtualNode
				component='this' name='client-node'/ /composedFrom
				/exportedVirtualNode /exportedVirtualNodes ...
				virtual-node name='client-node' cardinality='single'/
			</screen>
			<para>
				Although this is a simplistic example, one should
				foresee a situation where ClientImpl would be a
				prepackaged component, where its ADL could not be
				modified ; the exportation and composition of virtual
				nodes allow to adapt the deployment of the system
				depending on the existing infrastructure. Colocation can
				be specified in the enclosing component definition
				(helloworld-distributed-wrappers.fractal):
			</para>
			<screen>
				exportedVirtualNodes exportedVirtualNode name='VN1'
				composedFrom composingVirtualNode component='client'
				name='client-node' composingVirtualNode
				component='server' name='server-node'/ /composedFrom
				/exportedVirtualNode /exportedVirtualNodes
			</screen>
			<para>
				As a result, the client and server component will be
				colocated / deployed on the same virtual node. This can
				be profitable if there is a lot of communications
				between these two components.
			</para>
			<para>
				When specifying 'null' as the name of an exported
				virtual node, the components will be deployed on the
				current virtual machine. This can be useful for
				debugging purposes.

		<para>
			In this chapter, we consider multiway communications -
			communications to or from several interfaces - and notably
			parallel communications, which are common in Grid computing.
		</para>
		<para>
			Our objective is to simplify the design of distributed Grid
			applications with multiway interactions.
		</para>
		<para>
			The driving idea is to manage the semantics and behavior of
			collective communications at the level of the interfaces.

				<title>Motivations</title>
			</info>


			<para>
				Grid computing uses the resources of many separate
				computers connected by a network (usually the Internet)
				to solve large-scale computation problems. Because of
				the number of available computers, it is fundamental to
				provide tools for facilitating communications to and
				from these computers. Moreover, Grids may contain
				clusters of computers, where local parallel computations
				can be very efficiently performed - this is part of the
				solution for solving large-scale computation problems -
				, which means that programming models for Grid computing
				should include parallel programming facilities. We
				address this issue, in the context of a component model
				for Grid computing, by introducing
				<emphasis role="bold">collective interfaces</emphasis>
				.
			</para>

			<para>
				The component model that we use, Fractal, proposes two
				kinds of cardinalities for interfaces,
				<emphasis>singleton</emphasis>
				or
				<emphasis>collection</emphasis>
				, which result in one-to-one bindings between client and
				server interfaces. It is possible though to introduce
				binding components, which act as brokers and may handle
				different communication paradigms. Using these
				intermediate binding components, it is therefore
				possible to achieve one-to-n, n-to-one or n-to-n
				communications between components. It is not possible
				however for an interface to express a collective
				behavior: explicit binding components are needed in this
				case.
			</para>

			<para>
				We propose the addition of new cardinalities in the
				specification of Fractal interfaces, namely
				<emphasis>multicast</emphasis>
				and
				<emphasis>gathercast</emphasis>
				. Multicast and gathercast interfaces give the
				possibility to
				<emphasis>
					manage a group of interfaces as a single entity
				</emphasis>
				(which is not the case with a collection interface,
				where the user can only manipulate individual members of
				the collection), and they
				<emphasis>expose</emphasis>
				the collective nature of a given interface. Moreover,
				specific semantics for multiway invocations can be
				configured, providing users with flexible communications
				to or from gathercast and multicast interfaces. Lastly,
				avoiding the use of explicit intermediate binding
				components simplifies the programming model and type
				compatibility is automatically verified.
			</para>

			<para>
				The role and use of multicast and gathercast interfaces
				are complementary. Multicast interfaces are used for
				parallel invocations, whereas gathercast interfaces are
				used for synchronization and gathering purposes.
			</para>

			<para>
				Note that in our implementation of collective
				interfaces, new features of the Java language introduced
				in Java 5 are extensively used, notably annotations and
				generics.

						A multicast interface transforms a single

					</emphasis>
				</para>

				<para>
					A multicast interface is an abstraction for 1-to-n
					communications. When a single invocation is
					transformed into a set of invocations, these
					invocations are forwarded to a set of connected
					server interfaces. A multicast interface is unique
					and it exists at runtime (it is not lazily created).
					The semantics of the propagation of the invocation
					and of the distribution of the invocation parameters
					are customizable (through annotations), and the
					result of an invocation on a multicast interface -
					if there is a result - is always a list of results.
				</para>

				<para>
					Invocations forwarded to the connected server
					interfaces occur in parallel, which is one of the
					main reasons for defining this kind of interface: it
					enables
					<emphasis>
						parallel invocations, with automatic
						distribution of invocation parameters
					</emphasis>

					A multicast invocation leads to the invocation
					services offered by one or several connected server
					interfaces, with possibly distinct parameters for
					each server interface.
				</para>

				<para>
					If some of the parameters of a given method of a
					multicast interface are lists of values, these
					values can be distributed in various ways through
					method invocations to the server interfaces
					connected to the multicast interface. The default
					behavior - namely
					<emphasis>broadcast</emphasis>
					- is to send the same parameters to each of the
					connected server interfaces. In the case some
					parameters are lists of values, copies of the lists
					are sent to each receiver. However, similar to what
					SPMD programming offers, it may be adequate to strip
					some of the parameters so that the bound components
					will work on different data. In MPI for instance,
					this can be explicitly specified by stripping a data
					buffer and using the
					<emphasis>scatter</emphasis>
					primitive.

					mechanisms: broadcast (a.) and scatter (b.)

						<title>Results</title>
					</info>

					<para>
						For each method invoked and returning a result
						of type
						<literal>T</literal>
						, a multicast invocation returns an aggregation
						of the results: a
						<literal>List&lt;T&gt;</literal>
						.
					</para>

					<para>
						There is a type conversion, from return type
						<literal>T</literal>
						in a method of the server interface, to return
						type
						<literal>List&lt;T&gt;</literal>
						in the corresponding method of the multicast
						interface. The framework transparently handles
						the type conversion between return types, which
						is just an aggregation of elements of type
						<literal>T</literal>
						into a structure of type
						<literal>list&lt;T&gt;</literal>
						.
					</para>

					<para>
						This implies that, for the multicast interface,
						the signature of the invoked method has to
						explicitly specify
						<literal>List&lt;T&gt;</literal>
						as a return type. This also implies that each
						method of the interface returns either nothing,
						or a list. Valid return types for methods of
						multicast interfaces are illustrated as follows:
						<programlisting xml:lang="java">
							public List&lt;Something&gt; foo();

							public void bar();
						</programlisting>
					</para>

					<para>
						Otherwise, there is also a possibility to
						customize the result values by processing a
						reduction on them. This mechanism allows to
						gather results and/or perform some operations on
						them.
					</para>

					<para>
						There is one reduction mechanism provides by
						default: SELECT_UNIQUE_VALUE. It allows to
						extract of the list of results the only one
						result that the list contains. In order to use
						it, the multicast interface must use the
						<literal>
							org.objectweb.proactive.core.component.type.annotations.multicast.Reduce
						</literal>
						annotation at the level of the methods which the
						results need to be reduced:

						<programlisting xml:lang="java">
							@Reduce(reductionMode =
							ReduceMode.SELECT_UNIQUE_VALUE)
						</programlisting>
					</para>

					<para>
						Or else, a custom reduce mode can also be used.
						For this case, the first step is to defined the
						reduction algorithm into a class which
						implements the
						<literal>
							org.objectweb.proactive.core.component.type.annotations.multicast.ReduceBehavior
						</literal>

						A gathercast interface transforms a list of

					</emphasis>
				</para>

				<para>
					A gathercast interface is an abstraction for n-to-1
					communications. It handles data aggregation for
					invocation parameters, as well as process
					coordination. It gathers incoming data, and can also
					coordinate incoming invocations before continuing
					the invocation flow, by defining synchronization
					barriers.
				</para>

				<para>
					Gathering operations require knowledge of the
					participants of the collective communication (i.e.
					the clients of the gathercast interface). Therefore,
					the binding mechanism, when performing a binding to
					a gathercast interface, provides references on
					client interfaces bound to the gathercast interface.
					This is handled transparently by the framework. As a
					consequence, bindings to gathercast interfaces are
					bidirectional links.

				<para>
					An invocation from a client interface to a
					gathercast interface is asynchronous, provided it
					matches the usual conditions for asynchronous
					invocations in ProActive, however the gathercast
					interface only creates and executes a new invocation
					with gathered parameters when all connected client
					interfaces have performed an invocation on it.
				</para>

				<para>
					It is possible to specify a timeout, which
					corresponds to the maximum amount of time between
					the moment the first invocation of a client
					interface is processed by the gathercast interface,
					and the moment the invocation of the last client
					interface is processed. Indeed, the gathercast
					interface will not forward a transformed invocation
					until all invocations of all client interfaces are
					processed by this gathercast interface.
				</para>

				<para>
					Timeouts for gathercast invocations are specified by
					an annotation on the method subject to the timeout,
					the value of the timeout is specified in
					milliseconds:
					<programlisting xml:lang="java">
						@org.objectweb.proactive.core.component.type.annotations.gathercast.MethodSynchro(timeout=20)
					</programlisting>
				</para>

				<para>
					If a timeout is reached before a gathercast
					interface could gather and process all incoming
					requests, a
					<literal>
						org.objectweb.proactive.core.component.exceptions.GathercastTimeoutException
					</literal>
					is returned to each client participating in the
					invocation. This exception is a
					<emphasis>runtime</emphasis>
					exception.
				</para>

				<para>
					It is also possible for gathercast interface not to
					wait for all invocations from connected client
					interfaces to perform an invocation by specifying
					the waitForAll attribute. Therefore, the gathercast
					interface will create and execute a new invocation
					on the first invocation received from any of the
					connected client interfaces.
				</para>

				<para>
					Thus, this specific feature can be used by the same
					annotation as for the timeout but with a different
					attribute:
					<programlisting xml:lang="java">
						@org.objectweb.proactive.core.component.type.annotations.gathercast.MethodSynchro(waitForAll=false)
					</programlisting>
					Therefore, the waitForAll attribute accepts boolean
					values and has for default value "true" (same
					behavior as if the annotation is not specified).
				</para>

				<para>
					Furthermore, it is forbidden to combine timeout and
					waitForAll set to false (an
					<literal>
						org.objectweb.fractal.api.factory.InstantiationException
					</literal>
					is raised) because il would be incoherent.

					<title>Structuring the membrane with non-functional components</title>

				  <para> Components running in dynamically changing execution environments need
						to adapt to these environments. In Fractal and GCM (Grid Component
						Model) component models, adaptation mechanisms are triggered by the non-
						functional (NF) part of the components. Interactions with
						execution environments may require complex relationships between controllers.
						In this section we focus on the adaptability of the membrane.Examples include
						changing communication protocols, updating security policies, or taking into
						account new runtime environments in case of mobile components. Adaptability 
						implies that evolutions of the execution environments have to be detected and
						acted upon, and may also imply interactions with the environment and with
						other components for realizing the adaptation.
						
				</para>
				<para>
					We provide tools for adapting controllers. These 
					tools manage (re)configuration of controllers inside the membrane.For this, we provide a model and an implementation, using a standard component-
					oriented approach for both the application (functional) level and the control (NF)
					level. Having a component-oriented approach for the non-functional aspects
					also allows them to benefit from the structure, hierarchy and encapsulation
					provided by a component-oriented approach.
				</para>
				<para>
					In this section, we propose to design NF concerns as compositions of components as suggested in the GCM proposal.Our general objective is to allow
					controllers implemented as components to be directly plugged in a component
					membrane. These controllers take advantage of the properties of component
					systems like <emphasis>reconfigurability</emphasis>, i.e. changing of the contained components and
					their bindings.This allows components to be dynamically adapted in order to
					suit changing environmental conditions. Indeed, among others, we aim at a
					component platform appropriate for <emphasis>autonomic Grid applications</emphasis>; those appli-
					cations aim to ensure some quality of services and other NF features without
					being geared by an external entity.  
				 </para>
				 <para>	
				 	Components in the membrane introduce two major changes : first, refinements of the
					Fractal/GCM model concerning the structure of a membrane; second, a definition and an implementation of an API that allows GCM membranes to be
					themselves composed of components, possibly distributed. Both for efficiency and for flexibility reasons, we provide an implementation where controllers can
					either be classical objects or full components that could even be distributed. We
					believe that this high level of flexibility is a great advantage of this approach
					over the existing ones [8, 7]. Our model refinements also provide a better structure for the membrane and a better decoupling between the membrane and its
					externals. Finally, our approach gives the necessary tools for membrane reconfiguration, providing flexibility and evolution abilities. The API we present can
					be split in two parts:

					 <para>			
					    Here we present a simple example that shows the advantages of componen
						tizing controllers of GCM components. In our example, we are considering
						a naive solution for securing communications of a composite component. As
						described in Figure <xref linkend="figNaiveSolution"/>, secure communications are implemented by three components inside the membrane: Interceptor, Decrypt, and Alert. 
						The scenario of the example is the following: the composite component receives encrypted messages on its server functional interface. The goal is to decrypt those messages.
						First, the incoming messages are intercepted by the Interceptor component.
						It forwards all the intercepted communications to Decrypt, which can be an off-the-shelf component (written by cryptography specialists) implementing a
						specific decryption algorithm. The Decrypt component receives a key for decryption through the non-functional server interface of the composite (interface
						number 1 on the figure). If it successfully decrypts the message, the Decrypt
						component sends it to the internal functional components, using the functional
						internal client interface (2). If a problem during decryption occurs, the Decrypt
						component sends a message to the Alert component. The Alert component is
						charge to decide on how to react when a decryption fails. For example, it can
						contact the sender (using the non-functional client interface – 3) and ask it to
						send the message again. Another security policy would be to contact a “trust
						and reputation” authority to signal a suspicious behaviour of the sender. The
						Alert component is implemented by a developer who knows the security policy
						of the system. In this example, we have three well-identified components, with
						clear functionalities and connected through well-defined interfaces. Thus, we
						can dynamically replace the Decrypt component by another one, implementing
						a different decryption algorithm. Also, for changing the security policy of the
						system, we can dynamically replace the Alert component and change its connexions. Compared to a classical implementation of secure communications
						(for example with objects), using components brings to the membrane a better
						structure and reconfiguration possibilities. To summarize, componentizing the
						membrane in this example provides dynamic adaptability and reconfiguration;
						but also re-usability and composition from off-the-shelf components.

							Before defining an API for managing components inside the membrane, the
							definition of the membrane given by the GCM specification needs some refinements. Those refinements, discussed in this section, provide more details
							about the structure a membrane can adopt. Figure  <xref linkend="figStructure"/> represents the structure of
							a membrane and gives a summary of the different kinds of interface roles and
							bindings a GCM component can provide. As stated in the GCM specification,
							NF interfaces are not only those specified in the Fractal specification, which are
							only external server ones. Indeed, in order to be able to compose NF aspects,
							the GCM requires the NF interfaces to share the same specification as the functional ones: role, cardinality, and contingency. For example, in GCM, client
							NF interfaces allow for the composition of NF aspects and reconfigurations at
							the NF level. Our model is also flexible, as all server NF interfaces can be
							implemented by both objects or components controllers.
							</para>
							<para>	
							   All the interfaces showed in Figure  <xref linkend="figStructure"/> give the membrane a better structure
							and enforce decoupling between the membrane and its externals. For example,
							to connect <emphasis>nfc</emphasis> with <emphasis>fns</emphasis>, our model adds an additional stage: we have first to
							perform binding <emphasis>b3</emphasis>, and then binding <emphasis>b9</emphasis>. This avoids <emphasis>nfc</emphasis> to be strongly coupled
							with <emphasis>fns</emphasis>: to connect <emphasis>nfc</emphasis> to another <emphasis>fns</emphasis>, only binding <emphasis>b9</emphasis> has to be changed.
							   In Figure  <xref linkend="figStructure"/>, some of the links are represented with dashed arrows. Those
							links are not real bindings but “alias” bindings (e.g. b3); the source interface is
							the alias and it is “merged” with the destination interface. These bindings are
							similar to the export/import bindings existing in Fractal (b6, b10) except that
							no interception of the communications on these bindings is allowed.

								<para>
							        While componentizing the membrane clearly improves
									its programmability and its capacity to evolve, one can wonder what happens
									to performance. First, as our design choice allows object controllers, one can
									always keep the efficiency of crucial controllers by keeping them as objects.
									Second, the overhead for using components instead of objects is very low if the
									controllers components are local, and are negligible compared to the communication time, for example. Finally, if controllers components are distributed,
									then there can be a significant overhead induced by the remote communications, but if communications are asynchronous, and the component can run in
									parallel with the membrane, this method can also induce a significant speedup,
									and a better availability of the membrane. To summarize, controllers invoked
									frequently and performing very short treatments, would be more efficiently
									implemented by local objects or local components. For controllers called less
									frequently or which involve long computations, making them distributed would
									improve performances and availability of the membrane.

							</info>
								<para>
							      	To typecheck bindings between membranes, we have to extend the GCM model with a
									new concept: the non-functional type of a component. This type is defined as
									the union of the types of NF interfaces the membrane exposes. To specify the
									NF type of a component, we propose to overload the Fractal newFcInstance
									method (the one to create functional components) as follows:
									<programlisting xml:lang="java">
										public Component newFcInstance(Type fType,Type nfType, any contentDesc, any controllerDesc);
									</programlisting>
									In this method, nfType represents the NF type of the component; it can be
									specified by hand. Of course the standard Fractal type factory has to be extended
									in order to support all possible roles of NF interfaces. 
									Soon, it should be possible to specify the NF type within a configuration file: the controller
									descriptor argument (controllerDesc) can be a file written in Architecture
									Description Language (ADL) containing the whole description of the NF system.
								</para>	
								
								  <para>	
								    Components inside the membrane are <emphasis>non-functional components</emphasis>. They are
									similar to functional ones. However, their purpose is different because they deal
									with NF aspects of the <emphasis>host component</emphasis>. Thus, in order to enforce separation of
									concerns, we restrict the interactions between functional and NF components.
									For example, a NF component cannot be included inside the functional content
									of a composite. Inversely, a functional component cannot be added inside a
									membrane. As a consequence, direct bindings between functional interfaces of
									NF and functional components are forbidden.
									   To create NF components, we extend the common Fractal factories (generic
									factory and ADL factory). For generic factory, we add a method named
									newNFcInstance that creates this new kind of components:
									<programlisting xml:lang="java">
										public Component newNFcInstance(Type fType,Type nfType, any contentDesc, any controllerDesc);
									</programlisting>
									Parameters of this method are identical to its functional equivalent and NF
									components are created the same way as functional ones.

								To manipulate components inside membranes, we introduce primitives to perform basic operations like adding, removing or getting a reference on a NF component.
								We also need to perform calls on well-known Fractal controllers (life-cycle controller, binding controller, . . . )
								of these components. So, we extend Fractal/GCM specification by adding
								a new controller called membrane controller. As we want it to manage all the controllers, it is the only mandatory controller that has to belong to any
								membrane. It allows the manual composition of membranes by adding the
								desired controllers. The methods presented in Figure <xref linkend="codeAPI1"/> are included in the
								MembraneController interface; they are the core of the API and are sufficient
								to perform all the basic manipulations inside the membrane. They add, remove,
								or get a reference on a NF component. They also allow the management of ob-
								ject controllers and membrane’s life-cycle. Referring to Fractal, this core API
								implements a subset of the behavior of the life-cycle and content controllers
								specific to the membrane. This core API can be included in any Fractal/GCM
								implementation. Reconfigurations of NF components inside the membrane are
								performed by calling standard Fractal controllers. The general purpose API

							<para>
							        In Figure <xref linkend="codeAPI2"/>, we present an alternative API, that addresses NF components by their names instead of their
									references. These methods allow to make calls on the binding controller and
									on the life-cycle controller of NF components that are hosted by the component
									membrane. Currently, they don’t take into account the hierarchical aspect of
									NF components.
									The method calls address the NF components and
									call their controllers at once. For example, here is the Java code that binds
									two components inside the membrane using the general purpose API. It binds
									the interface “i1” of the component “nfComp1” inside the membrane to the
									interface “i2” of the component “nfComp2”. Suppose mc is a reference to the
									MembraneController of the host component.
									
									<programlisting xml:lang="java">
										Component nfComp1=mc.getNFcSubComponent("nfComp1");
										Component nfComp2=mc.getNFcSubComponent("nfComp2");
										Fractal.getBindingController(nfComp1).bindFc("i1",nfComp2.getFcInterface("i2"));
									</programlisting>
							 </para>		
							 <para>	
									Using the API of Figure <xref linkend="codeAPI2"/>, this binding can be realized by the following code, that binds the
									component “nfComp1” correctly.
									<programlisting xml:lang="java">
										mc.bindNFc("nfComp1.i1","nfComp2.i2");
									</programlisting>
									
									    Similarly to the example above, all the methods of Figure <xref linkend="codeAPI2"/> result in calls on
										well-known Fractal controllers. Interfaces are represented as strings of the form
										component.interface, where component is the name of the inner component and
										interface is the name of its client or server interface. We use the name “mem-
										brane” to represent the membrane of the host component, e.g. membrane.i1
										is the NF interface i1 of the host component; in this case interface is the name
										of an interface from the NF type. For example, <emphasis>bindNFc(string, string)</emphasis>
										allows to perform the bindings: <emphasis>b1</emphasis>, <emphasis>b2</emphasis>, <emphasis>b4</emphasis>, <emphasis>b3</emphasis>, <emphasis>b9</emphasis>, <emphasis>b7</emphasis> and <emphasis>b5</emphasis> of Figure <xref linkend="figStructure"/>.
									
									
							</para>	
							<para>	 
										The API presented in Figure <xref linkend="codeAPI2"/> introduced higher level mechanisms for reconfiguring the membrane. 
										It also solves the problem of local components inside the membrane.
										As usual in distributed
										programming paradigms, GCM objects/components can be accessed locally
										or remotely. Remote references are accessible everywhere, while local refer-
										ences are accessible only in a restricted address space. When returning a local
										object/component outside its address space, there are two alternatives: create
										a remote reference on this entity; or make a copy of it. When considering a
										copy of a NF local component, the NF calls are not consistent. If an invocation
										on getNFcSubComponent(string name) returns a copy of the specified NF
										component, calls performed on this copy will not be performed on the “real” NF
										component inside the membrane. Methods introduced in Figure <xref linkend="codeAPI2"/> solve this problem.

					For example, in the following figure, a simple

					communications. If the wrapping composites are
					distributed on different remote JVMs, all
					communications are remote because they have to cross
					composite enclosing components. The short cut
					optimization is a simple bypassing of the wrapper
					components, which results in 2 local communications
