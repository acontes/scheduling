	<sect1>
		<title>Overview</title>
		<para>
			Active objects are created on a per-object basis: an
			application can contain active as well as passive instances
			of a given class. In this section, we will present the three
			methods for creating active instances of classes and how to
			use the arguments passed to the methods to control creation.
			Although almost any object can be turned into an Active
			Object, there are some restrictions that will be detailed
			below. We also present a in depth explanation of the
			structure and behaviour of an active object.The examples in
			this chapter contain only the code necessary for creation of
			active object. To see how to start the nodes, JVMs, and
			virtual nodes on which objects can be instantiated read
			<xref linkend="Configuration" />
			
			
		</para>

		<para>
		
			In
			<emphasis role="bold">ProActive</emphasis>
			there are two ways to create active objects: instantiation
			based creation and by using an existing object. Instantion
			based creation is done through
			<literal>ProActiveObject.newActive(...)</literal>
			and
			<literal>ProActiveObject.newActiveInParallel(...)</literal>
			and object based creation is done through
			<literal>ProActiveObject.turnActive(...)</literal>.
			The methods are part of the
			<literal>org.objectweb.proactive.api</literal>
			package. Each method takes several parameters that control
			how the active object is created and most of the parameters
			are common between creation methods. All the available
			creation methods with parameters are presented in the
			<ulink
				url="http://proactive.inria.fr/release-doc/api/org/objectweb/proactive/ProActiveObject.html">
				ProActiveObject Javadoc

		<title>Restrictions on creating active objects</title>
		<para>
			Not all classes can be used to instantiate active objects.
			There are some restrictions, most of them caused by the 100%
			Java compliance, which forbids modifying the Java Virtual
			Machine or the compiler.
		</para>

		<para>Some of these restrictions work are at class-level:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					final classes cannot be used to instantiate active
					object
				</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>
					non public classes cannot be used to instantiate
					active object
				</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>
					classes without a no-argument constructor cannot be
					reified
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>
			There are also restrictions at method level within a class.
			Final methods cannot be used because the stub is created
			from the object and having methods final prevents the stub
			from overriding the methods.

		<title>Instantiation Based Creation</title>

		<para>
			When creating new instances of active objects we can use
			<literal>ProActiveObject.newActive(...)</literal>
			or
			<literal>ProActiveObject.newActiveInParallel(...)</literal>
			. ProActive also provides a way to create multiple active
			objects in parallel on several nodes.
			<literal>ProActiveObject.newActiveInParallel(...)</literal>
			creates a number of active objects deployed on one or more
			nodes. The object creation is optimized by a thread pool.
		</para>

		<para>
			When using instantiation based creation, any argument passed
			to the constructor of the reified object through
			<literal>ProActiveObject.newActive(...)</literal>
			or
			<literal>ProActiveObject.newActiveInParallel(...)</literal>
			is serialized and passed by copy to the object. That is
			because the model behind
			<emphasis role="bold">ProActive</emphasis>
			is uniform whether the active object is instantiated locally
			or remotely. The parameters are therefore guaranteed to be
			passed by copy to the constructor. When using
			<literal>ProActiveObject.newActive(...)</literal>
			, one needs to make sure that the constructor arguments are
			<literal>Serializable</literal>
			. On the other hand, the class used to create the active
			object does not need to be
			<literal>Serializable</literal>
			even in the case of remotely-created Active Objects. Bear in
			mind also that a reified object must have a declared empty
			no-args constructor in order to be properly created.

				To create a single active object from the class

				invocation of the constructor of class
				<literal>Worker</literal>
				throws an exception, it is placed inside an exception of
				type
				<literal>ActiveObjectCreationException</literal>
				. When the call to
				<literal>newActive</literal>
				returns, the active object has been created and its
				active thread is started.

		<title>Object Based Creation using <literal>ProActiveObject.turnActive(...)</literal></title>

		<para>
			Object based creation is used for turning an existing
			passive object instance into an active one. It has been
			introduced in ProActive as an answer to the problem of
			creating active objects from already existing objects for
			which we do not have access to the source code.
		</para>

		<para>
			Because the object already exists before turning it active,
			there is no serialization involved when we create the
			object. When we invoke
			<literal>ProActive.turnActive</literal>
			on the object, two cases are possible. If we create the
			active object locally (on a local node), it will not be
			serialized. If we create the active object remotely (on a
			remote node), the reified object will be serialized.
			Therefore, if the
			<literal>turnActive</literal>
			is done on a remote node, the class used to create the
			active object this way has to be
			<literal>Serializable</literal>
			. In addition, when using
			<literal>turnActive</literal>
			, care must be taken that no other references to the
			originating object are kept by other objects after the call
			to turnActive. A direct call to a method of the originating
			object without passing by a ProActive stub on this object
			will break the ProActive model.
		</para>

		<para>
			The simplest code for object based creation looks like this:
		</para>

		<programlisting lang="java"><textobject><textdata
			 fileref="code_snippets/simpleTurnActive.txt" /></textobject></programlisting>

		<para>
			The second parameter of
			<literal>turnActive</literal>
			is the location where the active object will be created. No
			parameter or
			<literal>null</literal>
			means that the active object is created locally in the
			current node.
		</para>

		<para>
			When using this method, the programmer has to make sure that
			no other reference on the passive object exist after the
			call to
			<literal>ProActiveObject.turnActive(...)</literal>.
			If such references are used for calling methods directly
			on the passive object (without going through its stub,
			proxy, and body), the model will not be consistent and
			specialization of synchronization will no be guaranteed.

			</title>
			<para>
				<literal>ProActiveObject.newActive(...)</literal>
				and
				<literal>
					ProActiveObject.newActiveInParallel(...)
				</literal>
				always take as a first argument the class name from
				which the active object will be instantiated. The
				<literal>classname</literal>
				argument must be of type
				<literal>java.lang.String</literal>
				and its value is usually obtained by calling
				<literal>
					ClassToInstantiateFrom.class.getName()
				</literal>
				.

				<literal>ProActiveObject.turnActive(...)</literal>
				does not create an active object from a class but from
				an existing object, therefore it takes as a first
				argument the object to be turned active.
			</para>
		</sect2>

		<sect2>
			<title>Using Constructor Arguments</title>
			<para>

				In order to create the active object
				<literal>ProActiveObject.newActive(...)</literal>
				and
				<literal>
					ProActiveObject.newActiveInParallel(...)
				</literal>
				must take a list of constructor arguments to be passed
				to the constructor of the class to be instantiated as an
				active object. Arguments to the constructor of the class
				have to be passed as an array of
				<literal>Object</literal>
				. Also, we have to make sure that the constructor
				arguments are
				<literal>Serializable</literal>
				since they are passed by a serialized copy to the
				object. The ProActive runtime determines which
				constructor of the class to call according to the type
				of the elements of this array. Nevertheless, there is
				still room for some ambiguity in resolving the
				constructor because as the arguments of the constructor
				are stored in an array of type
				<literal>Object[]</literal>
				or
				<literal>Object[][]</literal>
				. If one argument is null the runtime can obviously not
				determine its type. In this case a exception is thrown
				specifying that ProActive cannot determine the
				constructor. In the example below, an ambiguity exists
				between the two constructors if the corresponding
				element of the
				<literal>Object</literal>
				array is
				<literal>null</literal>
				.
			</para>

			<programlisting lang="java"><textobject><textdata

			<para>
				If we use
				<literal>
					ProActiveObject.newActiveInParallel(..., Nodes[]
					nodes)
				</literal>
				we have the make sure the length of the first dimension
				of
				<literal>java.lang.Object[][]</literal>
				is equal to the number of nodes since an active object
				will be deployed on each node. The second dimension of
				the array contains the constructor arguments for each
				deployed active object. Different active objects can
				have different constructor arguments.


				If we use
				<literal>
					ProActiveObject.newActiveInParallel(..., VirtualNode
					virtualNode)
				</literal>
				the virtual node will be activated if it is not active
				and one active object will be started on each node
				contained in the virtual node. In this case all the
				active objects take the same constructor arguments as we
				use a one dimensional array
				<literal>java.lang.Object[]</literal>
				.

			<title>Using A Node</title>
			<para>
				It is possible to pass an argument to the call to
				<literal>newActive</literal>
				in order to create the new active object on a specific
				JVM, possibly remote. The JVM is identified using a
				<literal>Node</literal>
				object, an array of
				<literal>Node</literal>
				or a
				<literal>String</literal>
				that contains an URL pointing to the node. If the
				parameter is not given, the active object is created in
				the current JVM and is attached to a default
				<literal>Node</literal>
				. The node argument and the URL string are used with
				<literal>ProActiveObject.newActive(...)</literal>
				and
				<literal>ProActiveObject.turnActive(...)</literal>.
				The array of
				<literal>Node</literal>
				and the virtual node argument is used with
				<literal>
					ProActiveObject.newActiveInParallel(...)
				</literal>
				. The virtual node will be activated if it is not active
				and one active object will be started on each node

			<title>Using A Custom Activity</title>


			<para>
				Customizing the activity of the active object is at the
				core of ProActive because it allows to specify fully the
				behavior of an active object. By default, an object
				turned into an active object serves its incoming
				requests in a FIFO manner. In order to specify another
				policy for serving the requests or to specify any other
				behaviors one can implement interfaces defining methods
				that will be automatically called by ProActive.
			</para>

			<para>
				It is possible to specify what to do before the activity
				starts, what the activity is and what to do after it
				ends. The three steps are:

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>

					<!-- //TODO - very complex, it might need its own section  -->
				</emphasis>
			</para>
			<para>
				Creating an active object using ProActive might be a
				little bit cumbersome and requires more lines of code
				that for creating a regular object. A nice solution to
				this problem is through the use of the
				<emphasis role="bold">factory</emphasis>
				pattern. This mainly applies to class based creation. It
				consists in adding a static method to class
				<literal>WorkerFactory</literal>
				that takes care of instantiating the active object and
				returns it. The code is:
			</para>

			<programlisting lang="java"><textobject><textdata

				create active objects:
			</para>
			<programlisting lang="java"><textobject><textdata 
				fileref="code_snippets/factoryCall.txt" /></textobject></programlisting>

			<para>
				It is up to the programmer to decide whether this method
				has to throw exceptions or not. We recommend that this
				method only throw exceptions that appear in the
				signature of the reified constructor (none here as the
				constructor of Worker that we call doesn't throw any
				exception). However, the non functional exceptions
				induced by the creation of the active object have to be
				dealt with somewhere in the code.

		<sect2>
			<title>
				Using
				<literal>MetaObjectFactory</literal>
				to customize the meta objects
			</title>

			<para>
				There are many cases where you may want to customize the
				body used when creating an active object. For instance,
				one may want to add some debug messages or some timing
				behavior when sending or receiving requests. The body is
				a non changeable object that delegates most of its tasks
				to helper objects called MetaObjects. Standard
				MetaObjects are already used by default in ProActive but
				one can easily replace any of those MetaObjects by a
				custom one.
			</para>

			<para>
				We have defined a
				<literal>MetaObjectFactory</literal>
				interface that is able to create factories for each of
				those MetaObjects. This interface is implemented by
				<literal>ProActiveMetaObjectFactory</literal>
				which provides all the default factories used in
				ProActive.
			</para>

			<para>
				When creating an active object, it is possible to
				specify which
				<literal>MetaObjectFactory</literal>
				to use for that particular instance of active object
				being created.
			</para>

			<para>
				First you have to write a new MetaObject factory that
				inherits from
				<literal>ProActiveMetaObjectFactory</literal>
				or directly implements the
				<literal>MetaObjectFactory</literal>
				interface. Inheriting from
				<literal>ProActiveMetaObjectFactory</literal>
				is a great time saver as you only redefine what you
				really need to as opposed to redefining everything when
				inheriting from
				<literal>MetaObjectFactory</literal>
				. Here is an example:

			<para>
				<programlisting lang="java"><textobject><textdata
							fileref="code_snippets/metaObjectFactory.txt" /></textobject></programlisting>
			</para>

			<para>
				The factory above simply redefines the
				<literal>RequestFactory</literal>
				in order to make the body use a new type of request. The
				method
				<literal>
					protected RequestFactory
					newRequestFactorySingleton()
				</literal>
				is one convenience method that
				<literal>ProActiveMetaObjectFactory</literal>
				(see code in
				<xref
					linkend="core/body/ProActiveMetaObjectFactory.java"
					role="javaFileSrc" />
				) provides to simplify the creation of factories as
				singleton. More explanations can be found in the<!-- This url can only work in the html generated files: in pdf there's no ".." -->

				<phrase os="pdf">
					<literal>
						org.objectweb.proactive.core.body.ProActiveMetaObjectFactory
					</literal>
					javadoc
				</phrase>
				. The use of that factory is fairly simple. All you have
				to do is to pass an instance of the factory when
				creating a new active object. If we take the same

				The role of the class
				<literal>Stub_Worker</literal>
				is to reify all method calls that can be performed
				through a reference of type
				<literal>Worker</literal>.
				Reifying a call simply means constructing an object 
				that represents the call(in
				our case, all reified calls are instance of class
				<literal>org.objectweb.proactive.core.mop.MethodCall</literal>),
				so it can be
				manipulated as any other object. The reified call is
				then processed by the other components of the active
				object in order to achieve the behavior we expect from
				an active object.

			<para>
				Using a standard object for representing
				elements of the language that are not normally objects
				(such as method calls, constructor calls, references,
				types,...) is at the core of
				<emphasis>metaobject programming</emphasis>.
				The metaobject protocol (MOP) ProActive is
				built on is described in

			<para>
				As one of our objectives is to provide transparent
				active objects, references to active objects of class
				<literal>Worker</literal>
				need to be of the same type as references to passive
				instances of
				<literal>Worker</literal>
				(this feature is called
				<emphasis>polymorphism</emphasis>
				between passive and active instances of the same class).
				This is why
				<literal>Stub_Worker</literal>
				is a subclass of class
				<literal>Worker</literal> by construction,
				 therefore allowing instances of class
				<literal>Stub_Worker</literal>
				to be assigned to variables of type
				<literal>Worker</literal>.
			</para>

			<para>
				Class
				<literal>Stub_Worker</literal>
				redefines each of the methods inherited from its
				superclasses. The code of each method of class
				<literal>Stub_Worker</literal>
				builds an instance of class
				<literal>org.objectweb.proactive.core.mop.MethodCall</literal>
				in order to represent the call to this method. This
				object is then passed to the
				<literal>BodyProxy</literal>
				, which returns an object that is returned as the result
				of the method call. From the caller's point of view,
				everything looks like if the call had been performed on
				an instance of
				<literal>Worker</literal>
				.
			</para>

			<para>
				Now that we know how stubs work, we can understand some
				of the limitations of ProActive:
			</para>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Obviously,
						<literal>Stub_Worker</literal>
						cannot redefine
						<literal>final</literal>
						methods inherited from class
						<literal>Worker</literal>.
						If the methods are final, calls to these methods are not
						reified but are executed on the stub, which may
						lead to unpredictable behavior.
					</para>

					<para>
						As there are 6 final methods in the base class
						<literal>Object</literal>,
						there is the question of how ProActive deals with these
						methods. In
						fact, 5 out of this 6 methods deal with thread
						synchronization (
						<literal>notify()</literal>
						,
						<literal>notifyAll()</literal>
						and the 3 versions of
						<literal>wait()</literal>
						). Those methods should not be used since an
						active object provides thread synchronization.
						Using the standard thread
						synchronization mechanism and ProActive thread
						synchronization mechanism at the same time might
						conflict and result in an very hard to debug behaviour.
					</para>

					<para>
						The last final method in the class
						<literal>Object</literal>
						is
						<literal>getClass()</literal>
						. When invoked on an active object,
						<literal>getClass()</literal>
						is not reified and therefore performed on the
						stub object, which returns an object of class
						<literal>Class</literal>
						that represents the class of the stub (
						<literal>Stub_Worker</literal>
						in our example) and not the class of the active
						object itself (
						<literal>Worker</literal>
						in our example). However, this method is seldom
						used in standard applications and it doesn't
						prevent the operator
						<literal>instanceof</literal>
						from working thanks to its polymorphic behavior.
						Therefore the expression
						<literal>(foo instanceof Worker)</literal>
						has the same value whether Worker is active or not.
					</para>
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
					<para>
						Getting or setting instance variables directly
						(not through a get or a set method) must be
						avoided for active objects because it
						results in getting or setting the value on the
						stub object and not on the instance of the class
						<literal>Worker</literal>. 
						This problem is usually worked around by using
						get/set methods for setting or reading
						attributes. This rule of strict encapsulation
						can also be found in JavaBeans or in most
						distributed object systems like RMI or CORBA.

			<title>Role of the proxy</title>

			<para>
				The role of the proxy is to handle asynchronism in calls
				to active object. More specifically, it creates future
				objects if possible and needed, forwards calls to bodies,
				and returns future objects to the stubs. As this class
				operates on
				<literal>MethodCall</literal>
				objects, it is absolutely generic and does not depend at
				all on the type of the stub that feeds calls in through
				its
				<literal>reify</literal>
				method.
			</para>
		</sect2>

		<sect2>
			<title>Role of the body</title>

			<para>
				The
				<literal>body</literal>
				is responsible for storing calls (actually,
				<literal>Request</literal>
				objects) in a queue of pending requests and processing
				these request according to a given synchronization
				policy. The default behaviour for the synchronization policy is FIFO.
				The Body has its
				own thread which chooses requests from the
				queue of request and executes the associated call.
			</para>
		</sect2>

		<sect2>
			<title>Role of the instance of class Worker</title>

			<para>
				There is also a standard instance of class
				<literal>Worker</literal>
				. It may contain some synchronized information in its
				<literal>live</literal>
				method, if any. As the body executes calls one by one,
				there cannot be any concurrent execution of two portions
				of code for this object by two different threads. This
				enables the use of pre and post-conditions and class
				invariants. As a consequence, the use of the keyword
				<literal>synchronized</literal>
				in class
				<literal>Worker</literal>
				should not be necessary. Any synchronization scheme that
				can be expressed through monitors and
				<literal>synchronized</literal>
				statements can be expressed using ProActive's high-level
				synchronization mechanism in a much more natural and
				user-friendly way.

				<!--  //TODO Explain asynchronous request -->
				Whenever possible a method call on an active object is
				reified as an asynchronous request. If not possible the
				call is synchronous and blocks until the reply is

				immediately returns a future object.
			</para>

			<para>
				This object acts as a placeholder for the result of the
				not-yet-performed method invocation. As a consequence,
				the calling thread can go on with executing its code, as
				long as it doesn't need to invoke methods on the
				returned object, in which case the calling thread is
				automatically blocked if the result of the method
				invocation is not yet available. Below are shown the
				different cases that can lead to an asynchronous call.

				As we can see, the creation of a future depends not only
				on the caller type, but also on the return object type.
				Creating a future is only possible if the object is
				reifiable. Although a future has a similar structure
				to an active object, a future object is not
				active. It only has a Stub and a Proxy as shown in
				the figure below:

				During its lifetime, an active object can create many

			<para>
				Each time a future is created, it is inserted in the

				result becomes available, the future object is removed
				from the pool. There are several methods in

			<sect2>
				<title>Methods affected by futures </title>
				<para>
					Any call to a future object is reified in order to
					be blocked if the future is not yet available and
					later executed on the result object. However, two
					methods don't follow this scheme: equals and
					hashCode. They are often called by other methods
					from the Java library, like
					<literal>HashTable.add()</literal>
					and so are most of the time out of control from the
					user. This can lead very easily to deadlocks if they
					are called on a not yet available object.
				</para>
				<para>
					There are some drawbacks with this technique, the
					main one being the impossibility to have a user
					override the default
					<literal>HashTable</literal>
					and
					<literal>equals()</literal>
					methods.
				</para>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
				
				<para>
					<emphasis role="bold">hashCode()</emphasis>
					Instead of returning the hashcode of the object, it

					equivalence between them.
				</para>
				</listitem>

				<listitem>

				<para>
				<emphasis role="bold">equals()</emphasis>
					The default implementation of
					<literal>equals()</literal>
					in the Object class is to compare the references of
					two objects. In ProActive it is redefined to compare
					the hashcode of two proxies. As a consequence it is
					only possible to compare two future object, and not
					a future object with a normal object.
				</para>

				<listitem>
				<para>
					<emphasis role="bold">toString()</emphasis>
					The
					<literal>toString()</literal>
					method is most of the time called with
					<literal>System.out.println()</literal>
					to turn an object into a printable string. In the
					current implementation, a call to this method will
					block on a future object like any other call, thus,
					one has to be careful when using it. As an example,
					trying to print a future object for debugging
					purpose will most of the time lead to a deadlock.
					Instead of displaying the corresponding string of a
					future object, you might consider displaying its

				<para>
					First, let's introduce the example we'll use
					throughout this section. Let us say that some piece
					of code in an instance of class
					<literal>A</literal>
					calls method
					<literal>foo</literal>
					on an active instance of class
					<literal>Worker</literal>.
					This call is asynchronous and returns a future
					object of class
					<literal>Value</literal>.
					Then, possibly after having executed some other
					code, the same thread that issued the call calls
					method
					<literal>bar</literal>
					on the future object returned by the call to
					<literal>foo</literal>.

					In a sequential, single-threaded version of the same

					in class
					<literal>V</literal>
					, and finally the code of the calling method
					in class

				<title>Sequence Diagram</title>

				<para>
					The sequence of calls is more complex for the active object
					case.	We have now two
					threads: the thread that belongs to object's <literal>A</literal>
					subsystem,  and the thread that belongs to
					 the <literal>Worker</literal>'s subsystem. 
					We will call these the first and second threads. 
			</para>

				<para>
					The first thread invokes
					<literal>foo</literal>
					on an instance of
					<literal>Stub_Worker</literal>
					, which builds a
					<literal>MethodCall</literal>
					object and passes it to the
					<literal>BodyProxy</literal>
					as a parameter of the call to be
					<literal>reified</literal>
					. The proxy then checks the return type of the call
					(in this case
					<literal>Value</literal>
					) and generates a future object of type
					<literal>Value</literal>
					for representing the result of the method
					invocation. The future object is actually composed
					of a
					<literal>Stub_V</literal>
					and a
					<literal>FutureProxy</literal>.
					A reference onto this future object is set in the
					<literal>MethodCall</literal>
					object. This reference will be used to set the value 
					after the call has executed. When the
					<literal>MethodCall</literal>
					object is ready, it is passed as a parameter for a Request to the
					<literal>Body</literal>
					of the <literal>Worker</literal> active object. The 
					<literal>Body</literal> simply
					appends this request to the queue of pending
					requests and returns immediately. The call to
					<literal>foo</literal> issued by <literal>A</literal>
					returns a future object of type	<literal>Stub_Value</literal>,
					that is a subclass of
					<literal>Value</literal>.
				</para>

				<para>
					At some point, possibly after having served some
					other requests, the
					second thread
					(the active object's thread) picks up the previous request issued by
					the	first thread. It then executes the embedded call by
					calling
					<literal>foo</literal>
					on the instance of
					<literal>Worker</literal>
					with the actual parameters stored in the
					<literal>MethodCall</literal>
					object. As specified in its signature, this call
					returns an object of type
					<literal>Value</literal>. The second thread
					is responsible for setting this object in the
					future object (which is the reason why
					<literal>MethodCall</literal>
					objects hold a reference on the future object
					created by the <literal>FutureProxy</literal>).
					The execution of the call is now over, and the
					second thread can select and serve another request from
					the queue.
				</para>

				<para>
					In the meantime, the
					first thread
					has continued executing the code of the calling
					method in class
					<literal>A</literal>.
					At some point, it calls
					<literal>bar</literal>
					on the object of type
					<literal>Stub_Value</literal>
					that was returned by the call to
					<literal>foo</literal>. This call is reified thanks to the
					<literal> Stub_Value </literal>and processed by the
					<literal> FutureProxy</literal>. If the object the
					 future represents is available
					(the second thread	has already set it in the future object),
					the call is executed and returns a value to the calling code in
					<literal>A</literal>. The sequence diagram below presents the
					process graphically.

			<title>Lightweight failure detection</title>

			<para>
				Waiting for the update of a future in a ProActive
				application could freeze the application  if the node
				responsible for
				updating the future experiences a failure. To prevent this,
				ProActive has a comprehensive generic
				fault tolerance mechanism. However, it can be too expensive
				to checkpoint all the active objects, when fault detection 
				is only needed for certain objects.
				<!-- //TODO AMBIGOUS ASK -->
			</para>

			<para>
				By default, ProActive continuously pings active objects
				expected to update awaited futures. When such a ping fails,
				the associated awaited future is updated with a runtime
				exception. Accessing the future will throw
				an exception.
			</para>

			<programlisting lang="java"><textobject><textdata fileref="code_snippets/futureException.txt"></textdata></textobject></programlisting>

			<para>
				The ping is started when the future is being awaited, but

				Automatic continuation is the propagation of a

			<para>
				Automatic continuations allows for using 
				still not updated future in the normal program flow without 
				blocking to wait for updating the result in the future.  
								
				When the result is available on the object

				updates the result in all the objects to which it passed

			<title>Sending Futures</title>

					<para>
						An automatic continuation can occur when sending a
						request (parameter of the request is a future or
						contains a future) or when sending a reply (the
						result is a future or contains a future).
						Outgoing futures are registered in the
						<literal>FuturePool</literal>
						of the Active Object sending the future.
						Registration for the couple Future - destination Body 
						as an automatic	continuation occurs when the future is
						serialized. Every request or reply are
						serialized before being sent, and the future is
						part of the request or the reply. 
						
						
						A thread
						<literal>Thread</literal>
						sending the message keeps in a static table (<literal>FuturePool.bodyDestination</literal>)
						 a reference to the destination body. Hence
						when a future
						<literal>Future</literal>
						is serialized by the same thread, looks up in the
						static table the destination
						<literal>Destination</literal>
						registered for the thread
						<literal>Thread</literal>>.
						 If it finds a destination for the future, the future notifies the
						<literal>FuturePool</literal>
						that it is going to leave, which in turn
						registers the couple Future - Destination Body as an automatic
						continuation
					</para>

					<para>
						When the value	is available for the future, it is 
						is propagated to all objects that received the
						future <literal>Future</literal>.
						This type of update is realized by a thread
						located in the	<literal>FuturePool</literal>.

					<title>Receiving Futures</title>
			
							<para>
						When a message containing a future is received by

						steps:

				To illustrate how automatic continuation takes place we will use three classes:

				 objects and the <literal> Worker </literal> class is used to instantiate an active object.
				 The <literal>Worker</literal> class has a <literal> foo() </literal> method and the

		<title>Event based programming</title>

  	<para>
			ProActive supports an event based programming model. That
			is, an active object can schedule one of its method to be
			called when a future is updated. This method will be
			enqueued into the active object adding the callback. Here is
			an excerpt from a class using the mechanism:
		</para>

		<programlisting lang="java">
			public class MyActiveObject { public void
			myCallback(Future&lt;StringWrapper&gt; future) { try {
			String s = future.get().stringValue();
			System.out.println("Got this value: " + s); } catch
			(InterruptedException e) { /* This cannot happen */ return;
			} catch (ExecutionException e) { System.out.println("Got an
			exception instead of the future: " + e.getCause()); return;
			} }

			public void someRunningMethod(SomeActiveObjectClass ao) {
			StringWrapper result = ao.foo();
			ProFuture.addActionOnFuture(result, "myCallback"); } }
		</programlisting>

		<para>
			As seen in the example, the callback method takes the Future
			as parameter, it is the java.util.concurrent.Future one. It
			is also possible to set the callback method to an immediate
			service method.
