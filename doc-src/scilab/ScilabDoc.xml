            is a scientific software for numerical computations.
            Developed since 1990 by researchers from INRIA and ENPC, it
            is now maintained and developed by Scilab Consortium since
            its creation in May 2003. Scilab includes hundreds of
            mathematical functions with the possibility to add
            interactively programs from various languages (C,
            Fortran...). It has sophisticated data structures (including
            lists, polynomials, rational functions, linear systems...),
            an interpreter and a high level programming language. Scilab
            works on most Unix systems (including GNU/Linux) and Windows
            (9X/2000/XP).

            <emphasis>Matlab</emphasis>
            is a numerical computing environment and programming
            language. Created by The MathWorks, Matlab allows easy
            matrix manipulation, plotting of functions and data,
            implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces,
            and interfacing with programs in other languages. Although
            it specializes in numerical computing, an optional toolbox
            interfaces with the Maple symbolic engine, allowing it to be
            part of a full computer algebra system.

            As of 2004, MATLAB was used by more than one million people
            in industry and academia.

            The goal of the ProActive Interface is to equip Scilab and
            Matlab with a generic interface to Grid computing. This
            extension allows the deployment of Scilab/Matlab instances
            on several nodes of the grid (and to use these instances
            like computing engines) and submitting of Scilab/Matlab
            tasks over the grid. These engines are monitored by a
            central ProActive API. A natural condition is to deploy an
            application (based on this interface) strictly on hosts
            where the Scilab or Matlab software is installed.

                To launch the application, you have to execute the

                Once the application is started, the main frame is

            <para>
                The first step is to deploy the topology of the
                application. A dialog enables to choice the descriptor
                and to select the virtual node. The button
                <emphasis>deploy</emphasis>
                launches the deployment of Matlab/Scilab engines over
                the nodes.

                The next step is the task launching. A dialog enables to
                select the script and possibly to define the script
                initialization, the return values, and the task
                priority. The button
                <emphasis>start</emphasis>
                creates and sends the task.

                on a task in the table of terminated tasks sets visible
                a dialog. This dialog displays the tasks properties and

                application. These tables allows to show just for each
                task the relevant informations. A double click on a task
                in these tables sets visible a dialog. This dialog

                    The deployment is made thank to a ProActive
                    descriptor. This deployment descriptor describes the
                    different nodes of the grid taking part at the
                    computation. A singularity of this descriptor is the
                    declaration of specific matlab/scilab environment
                    variables for each node. The deployment is achieved
                    by a call of the method "deployEngine". This method
                    takes in parameters the VirtualNode id, the
                    descriptor path, and the number of engines to
                    create.

                    the call, the task is set in pending queue. This
                    queue is managed like a FIFO with priority. The task
                    is in head of the queue is sent when a engine is

            The class
            <literal>SciTask</literal>
            describes a scilab task. It defines In and Out data, the job
            and the job initialization. A job is a scilab script
            (*.sce), it contains all instructions executed by a remote
            engine. In data and the job initialization allow to
            customize the execution and Out data define the values to
            return after the execution.

            The class

            describes a matlab task. It defines similar data as the
            scilab task. A job is a scilab script (*.m).

        <para>
            The class

            describes a result of a Scilab or Matlab task. A result is
            the list of return values (defining in the task).

            The following example
            <xref linkend="sciex1"/>
            presents how to compute a basic scilab task and to display
            the result. In our case the task initializes the variable
            <literal>"n"</literal>
            and increments it. The next example shows a possibly
            deployment descriptor
