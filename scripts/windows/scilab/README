ProActive GUI for Matlab/Scilab.

Before being able to use the extension and launch the GUI (scilab.sh or scilab.bat), please follow these installations steps.

---------------------------------------------  SCILAB --------------------------------------------------
For every machines that you will be using:

STEP 1:
If you're machine is a 32 bit Linux or Windows:

	Download Scilab 4.1.2 or above BINARY Version
	
The Scilab Java interface doesn't work properly in 64 bits mode. But you can still use it on a 64 bits-architecture in 32 bits-mode.
 
	In order to do that use the 4.1.2 BINARY version or compile a source version on a similar 32 bit similar OS distribution.

If you want to compile the library from a source version :

	Download Scilab 4.1.2 SOURCE Version.

	make binaries of Scilab (procedure is explained  in SCILAB/Readme_Linux or SCILAB/Readme_Windows)
	
	After the build, make sure that you find libjavasci.so or javasci.dll in the SCILAB/bin directory

If you successfully did STEP 1, skip STEP 2.  

STEP 2: 
If you can't have access to Scilab 4.1.2 or want to use an earlier version, download Scilab SOURCE version 4.1 or 4.1.1 (lower versions are not supported)

copy javasci_Scilab2.h and javasci_Scilab2.c from folder c_sources to SCILAB/routines/Javasci/

make binaries of Scilab (procedure is explained  in SCILAB/Readme_Linux or SCILAB/Readme_Windows)

After the build, make sure that you find libjavasci.so or javasci.dll in the SCILAB/bin directory

---------------------------------------------- MATLAB ---------------------------------------------------
For every machines that you will be using:

STEP 1: If you plan to use Matlab, you must have Matlab installed and a valid licence.

STEP 2: IMPORTANT ! you need to compile and install Matlab Java Interface libraries, in order to do that, follow the guidelines in PROACTIVE/scripts/unix/matlab/README
 

--------------------------------------------- For Both ---------------------------------------------------
STEP 3:
Edit paths to your SCILAB installation in the scilab_env.sh or scilab_env.bat file

Comment out the following line if present in the SCILAB/scilab.star file (should be around line 190):
show_startupinfo();

To comment out just insert "//" in the beginning of the line like in Java.  

STEP 4:
If you use a source version of ProActive, compile ProActive by the following (PROACTIVE refers to the directory where you installed ProActive):
> cd PROACTIVE/scripts/[unix|windows]/scilab
> build.[sh|bat] compile

STEP 5: 
Read documentation on http://proactive.inria.fr/scilab.htm on how to use the GUI

Edit paths inside the ProActiveScilab.xml descriptor if you want to use it to deploy on remote machines, if you want to deploy locally use the ProActiveScilabLocal.xml descriptor


STEP 6:
Run scilab.sh or scilab.bat. 



ATTENTION :

If you want to use the extension without the script, remember that the environment variables of the JVM used to launch Scilab/Matlab engines must be set according to the scilab_env.[sh|bat] script
