ProActive GUI for Matlab/Scilab.

Before being able to use the extension and launch the GUI (scilab.sh or scilab.bat), please follow these installations steps.

---------------------------------------------  SCILAB --------------------------------------------------
For every machines that you will be using:

STEP 1:
If you're machine is a 32 bit Linux or Windows:

	Download Scilab 4.1.2 or above BINARY Version

Otherwise, Download Scilab 4.1.2 SOURCE Version.

	make binaries of Scilab (procedure is explained  in SCILAB/Readme_Linux or SCILAB/Readme_Windows)

If you successfully did STEP 1, skip STEP 2.  

STEP 2: 
If you can't have access to Scilab 4.1.2, download Scilab SOURCE version 4.1 or 4.1.1

copy javasci_Scilab2.h and javasci_Scilab2.c from folder c_sources to SCILAB/routines/Javasci/

make binaries of Scilab (procedure is explained  in SCILAB/Readme_Linux or SCILAB/Readme_Windows)

---------------------------------------------- MATLAB ---------------------------------------------------
For every machines that you will be using:

STEP 1: If you plan to use Matlab, you must have Matlab installed and a valid licence.

STEP 2: you need to compile and install Matlab Java Interface libraries, in order to do that, follow the guidelines in PROACTIVE/scripts/unix/matlab/README
 

--------------------------------------------- For Both ---------------------------------------------------
STEP 3:
Edit paths to your SCILAB installation in the scilab_env.sh or scilab_env.bat file

Comment out the following line if present in the SCILAB/scilab.star file (should be around line 190):
show_startupinfo();

To comment out just insert "//" in the beginning of the line like in Java.  

STEP 4:
If you use a source version of ProActive, compile ProActive by the following (PROACTIVE refers to the directory where you installed ProActive):
> cd PROACTIVE/scripts/[unix|windows]/scilab
> build.[sh|bat] compile

STEP 5: 
Read documentation on http://proactive.inria.fr/scilab.htm on how to use the GUI

Edit paths inside the ProActiveScilab.xml descriptor if you want to use it to deploy on remote machines, if you want to deploy locally use the ProActiveScilabLocal.xml descriptor


STEP 6:
Run scilab.sh or scilab.bat. 



ATTENTION :

If you want to use the extension without the script, remember two things :

Under Linux, the environment variables must be set according to the scilab_env.sh script AND the java property java_library_path must contain the directory where the libjavasci.so can be found

Under Windows, the Class PATH environment variable must contain the path to where the javasci.dll can be found
