!        Matlab interface to ProActive        !
!---------------------------------------------!

The Matlab interface to ProActive allows you to schedule Matlab scripts on a distributed environment using either:

1) The standalone Matlab/Scilab ProActive GUI
2) The ProActive scheduler

You need to compile a native libary called Ptolemy that will link against the native libaries of your Matlab intallation.

The scripts in this directory can be run on Linux or Cygwin(Windows)

In order to build the libraries, first set the MATLAB environment variable to the full path of your Matlab command.

Make sure that the javac command from a Java JDK (and not JRE) is accessible in the Path. 

Under Cygwin you need to set the right Path and the MATLAB environment variable by System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables (don't define them directly under Cygwin). 

On the prompt run:

> configure
> make

This will copy the Ptolemy library to Proactive's lib directory. Please note that this library depends on two things:
1) The Matlab version
2) Your architecture (Linux, 32 or 64 bit, Windows, Sun Solaris, etc...)

Therefore:
1) If you want to connect ProActive to another Matlab version you'll need to provide a MATLAB variable that will point to this other version and relaunch the scripts.
2) If you want to connect ProActive to a Matlab installed on a different architecure, you'll need to relaunch the scripts on this architecture.


Please note that after you've run the scripts for each version/architecture you will be able to launch Matlab jobs that can run on heterogeneous systems.
