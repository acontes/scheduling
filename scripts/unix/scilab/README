ProActive Extension for Scilab/Matlab.

Before being able to use the extension and launch the GUI (scilab.sh), please follow these installations steps.

--------------------------------        SCILAB          --------------------------------------


STEP 1: Download Scilab 4.1.2 or above BINARY Version

If you can't download version 4.1.2 please follow step 2.


STEP 2 (source version only): Download Scilab SOURCE version 4.1 or 4.1.1

copy javasci_Scilab2.h and javasci_Scilab2.c from folder PROACTIVE/scripts/linux/scilab/c_sources to SCILAB/routines/Javasci/

make binaries of Scilab (procedure is explained  in SCILAB/Readme_Linux or SCILAB/Readme_Windows)


STEP 3:
Edit paths to your SCILAB installation in the scilab_env.sh file

Comment out the following line if present in the SCILAB/scilab.star file (should be around line 190):
show_startupinfo();

To comment out just insert "//" in the beginning of the line like in Java.  


STEP 4: 
Read documentation on http://proactive.inria.fr/scilab.htm on how to use the GUI

Edit paths inside the ProActiveScilab.xml descriptor if you want to use it to deploy on remote machines, if you want to deploy locally use the ProActiveScilabLocal.xml descriptor


STEP 5:
Run scilab.sh. 


--------------------------------        MATLAB          --------------------------------------

STEP 1:
Edit paths to your MATLAB installation in the scilab_env.sh file

STEP 2: 
Read documentation on http://proactive.inria.fr/scilab.htm on how to use the GUI

Edit paths inside the ProActiveScilab.xml descriptor if you want to use it to deploy on remote machines, if you want to deploy locally use the ProActiveScilabLocal.xml descriptor

STEP 3:
Run scilab.sh. 


--------------------------------      STANDALONE USE    --------------------------------------

If you want to use the extension without the script, remember several things :

In order to run Scilab or Matlab from ProActive, several native libraries and jar files are needed. 

**** Native libraries *****

Scilab :          native libraries contained in SCILAB/bin (including libjavasci.so which is the Scilab/Java interface)

Matlab : 		  libptmatlab.so contained in PROACTIVE/lib
				  native libraries contained in MATLAB/bin/glnx86 and MATLAB/sys/os/glnx86
				  
The JVM must be executed with the java.library.path property set and containing these paths

******** JAR files *********   

Scilab: 
	javasci.jar contained in PROACTIVE/lib

Matlab:
	ptolemy.jar contained in PROACTIVE/lib
