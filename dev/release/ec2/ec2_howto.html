                     If the default public image doesn't fit your needs, you can bundle your own AMI.
                     The advantages of doing so is that you can:

                     Windows AMI creation, however, cannot be automated.

                           	    To create an AMI, you need an S3 account. This Amazon Service allows you to store online data,
                           	    this is where AMI are uploaded and made available to users.
                           	    Sign up for Amazon S3 at

                        <p>
                           	    On the AWS website, find the menu called <span class="emphasis"><em>Your Web Services Account</em></span>,
                           	    and select <span class="emphasis"><em>AWS Access Identifiers</em></span>.
                           	    You are now going to generate an <span class="emphasis"><em>X.509</em></span> certificate, which consists
                           	    in a public (cert-xxx.pem) and private key (pk-xxx.pem).
                           	    Download those keys on you local drive, and be sure to set the right permissions
                           	    (chmod 600).

                           	    You need to get the command line tools to interact with EC2,
                           	    which consist in two packages:
                           	    <a class="link" href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=368&amp;categoryID=88" target="_top">

                              	      the EC2 API tools</a>.
                           	    The scripts for both tools need to be located in the same directory, ie. the content of ~/api-tools/bin and ~/ami-tools/bin
                           need to end up in
                           	    the same ~/ec2-tools/bin, so that the $EC2_HOME environment variable, which all those scripts use, is set to ~/ec2-tools/.

                        <p>
                           	    Now you need to setup your shell environment (for example in your ~/.bashrc) so that the EC2 command line tools
                           	    can work properly:

                        <p>
                           	    You can now generate an RSA key, that will allow direct SSH connections to instances you create.
                           	    
                        </p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>
                           	    Your key is now registered on EC2 as <span class="emphasis"><em>foo-ec2-keypair</em></span>.
                           
                           	    Add the following to your environment:

                        <p>
                           	    Now, you need to create you own Bucket. A Bucket is basically a folder on Amazon S3,
                           	    where you are going to put your new AMI.
                           	    You need to get the S3 command tools and follow the instructions at
                           	    <a class="link" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_top">http://s3tools.org/s3cmd/</a>.
                           	    Once your bucket is created, add the following to your environment:
                           	    
                        </p><pre class="screen">

                        <p>
                           	    Add to your environment values for <span class="emphasis"><em>AWS_AKEY</em></span>,
                           	    <span class="emphasis"><em>AWS_SKEY</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>EC2_USER</em></span>, which you already put
                           	    in the file <span class="emphasis"><em>/config/deployment/ec2.properties</em></span> as described in
				    the Scheduling user documentation.

               <p>
                  	Now that your environment is set, you can run the AMI creation script, which is located in
                  	<span class="emphasis"><em>/dev/release/ec2/createAMI.sh</em></span>. Its purpose is to create an AMI that will
                  	embed Scheduler, launch a ProActive runtime at boot and register it to
                  	a remote Resource Manager given dynamic parameters.
                  	To achieve this, the scripts creates a new EC2 instance, sends archives containing the required
                  	components on it, install them, and bundles a new image given the current state of the instance.
                        
               </p>
                     
               <p>

                           	      <span class="emphasis"><em>-a AMI</em></span>, specify a custom initial AMI instead of the default Fedora 8.
                           	      To create an AMI, this script boots a new instance with an initial AMI, installs all components
                           	      on it, and then makes a snapshot of the modified instance to upload a new AMI.
                           	      Using different initial images lead to different AMI: this scripts works fine with the default Fedora,
                           	      and has been successfully tested with a Debian initial AMI. If the AMI specified with
                           	      the -a switch is too different from the tested ones, the script may fail. Possible reasons include:

                                    		    You may get a 'X: command not found' error if one of those tools is not present.
                                    		    Solution to this problem is to find an equivalent and adapt the script,

                           	      and Java. To create the new AMI, this script will install archives containing ProActive Scheduling
                           	      and Java. Default values are the JDK located at $JAVA_HOME if set, and the Scheduling version this
                           	      script is located in. Alternatively, you can specify a .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2 or .zip archive
                           	      for -p and -j: this makes the script faster, as it doesn't need to create the archives itself,

                           	    The simplest way is to put a zipped archive of the whole tree on a remote HTTP server,

                           	    From now on, we will assume that the ProActive root directory is <span class="emphasis"><em>C:\ProActive</em></span>
                           	    (ie. you should have a C:\ProActive\dist\lib\ProActive.jar).

                           	    Now is the tricky part: to start a ProActive runtime at boot, we need to register
                           	    a Java program, or a Batch script running a Java program, as a Windows Service.
                           	    Because of Java, however, this is not a task you can achieve trivially on Windows.
                           	    We are going to need a Java Service Wrapper that will launch our Java program the right
                           	    way so that it can be started as an NT Service.
                           	    Several projects exist, we will use <span class="emphasis"><em>Java Service Wrapper</em></span> in this guide.

                                 	    When creating a paid AMI, if you do not pay attention,
                                 	    users that purchase your AMI once may be able to rebundle it,
                                 	    and then use it for free; if you do not want that to happen, you
                                 	    need to prevent root access to the AMI at creation.

                                          		  On a linux system, when creating the AMI with the <span class="emphasis"><em>createAMI.sh</em></span> script,
                                          		  use the <span class="emphasis"><em>-w</em></span> switch to be able to run commands just before the bundling process.
                                          		  The simplest way to prevent root access is to disable the SSH daemon; this will however
                                          		  also prevent you from rebundling it, a better solution is to manipulate
                                          		  the ssh configuration to accept only you key.

                                          		  On Windows, disabling the Remote Desktop service should be enough:
                                          		  go to the <span class="emphasis"><em>System Properties</em></span> dialog, and uncheck "Allow users to connect
                                          		  remotely on this computer" in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Remote</em></span> tab.
