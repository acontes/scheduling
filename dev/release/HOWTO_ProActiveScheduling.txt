For a major or minor release (aka x.y.0):
	- Create a dedicated branch
		- Set serialVersionUid to xy for all serializable class
		- Check copyrights
	- Do not forget XSD schema export for major release (execute 'set_xsd_urls.sh SCHEDULER_HOME x.y' and copy schema to website)
		
Then, for a major, minor or maintenance release (aka x.y.z):
	- Build RCPs
		- replace every 11[.]22[.]33 pattern in RCP with proper version x.y.z
		- /!\ DON'T FORGET TO USE THE LAST CHARTIT FROM THE LAST OPTIMIZING VERSION
	- Build the release
		- cd SCHEDULER_HOME
		- dev/release/releaseit.sh . /path/to/generated/RCP x.y.z path/to/store/final/release/archives [$JAVA_HOME]
