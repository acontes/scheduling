Building RCP using the headless way
-----------------------------------

Each RCP has two plugins dedicated to the headless build (script and
headless).
The feature plugin lists the dependencies of the RCP in terms of
features and plugins and provides a feature representing the RCP
itself.

The outputs of a compilation are the archives of the RCP for all the
platforms listed in the xxx.script/build.properties

Before any compilation be sure to have all the
mandatory features/plugins available within your eclipse.

The archive produced at the end of the build are put in the
dist/scheduler-rcp and/or dist/rm-rcp directories.

Prerequisites:
-------------

The deltapack is required. The default search location is
eclipse/deltapack.
Override this location by setting the variable 'deltapack' to the
correct location

Mandatory variables :

eclipse.baseLocation : set the path to eclipse's installation
directory.


Preparing the headless compilation
----------------------------------

Before any compilation of the RCPs, some files have to be copied in
several locations in the plugins. This step is handled by two ant
targets rcp.libCopy.all and rcp.libClean.all.

# cd compile
# ./build rcp.libClean.all rcp.libCopy.all

The scheduler and RM RCPs rely on some plugins IC2D
(org.objectweb.proactive.ic2d.lib and
org.objectweb.proactive.ic2d.chartit).

------------------- WARNING ----------
Be sure that the version of ProActive provided by
org.objectweb.proactive.ic2d.lib is the same that the one that comes
with the scheduler.
--------------------------------------


Compilation of the RCPs
-----------------------

By default, the headless build looks for the plugins in the parent directory that
contains the plugin script. To extend the search path, one can use the
rcp.pluginPath variable.

for instance, under a unix system, the variable could be
rcp.pluginPath=/home/xxx/workspace/optimizing/src:/home/xxx/workspace/scheduling/scheduler-rcp:/home/xxx/workspace/scheduling/rm-rcp


   Command-line compilation
   ------------------------
Go under the (scheduler|rm) script plugin and launch the command

# java -jar
/path/to/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_x.y.z.jar
-application org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner


   Ant-based compilation
   ---------------------

the ant-base d compilation also supports building RCPs in headless
mode. Several variables have to be filled in before the launching the
compilation:

- equinoxjar : this variable references the
org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_xxx.jar file located within the plugin
directory of your eclipse's installation

- eclipse.baseLocation : the location of eclipse

- rcp.pluginPath : the locations of optimizing's source file and scheduler
and resource manager rcps' source.


# ./build -Dequinoxjar=... -Declipse.baseLocation=...\
  -Drcp.pluginPath=... rcp.build.rm rcp.build.scheduler
