				<emphasis>Scilab</emphasis>
				is a scientific software for numerical computations.
				Developed since 1990 by researchers from INRIA and ENPC,
				it is now maintained and developed by Scilab Consortium
				since its creation in May 2003. Scilab includes hundreds
				of mathematical functions with the possibility to add
				interactively programs from various languages (C,
				Fortran...). It has sophisticated data structures
				(including lists, polynomials, rational functions,
				linear systems...), an interpreter and a high level
				programming language. Scilab works on most Unix systems
				(including GNU/Linux) and Windows (9X/2000/XP).

                The interface with Scilab inside ProActive comes as a Scilab Toolbox that can be directly accessed from the Scilab environment (ProActive Toolbox). The objectives of <emphasis>ProActive Toolbox</emphasis> are to provide you with tools that:

            The toolbox works only with Scilab version <emphasis>5.3</emphasis> and higher. The toolbox depends on another toolbox called <emphasis>Java Interaction Mechanism in Scilab</emphasis>(JIMS) which must be downloaded and installed from <emphasis>ATOMS</emphasis> before installing the ProActive Toolbox.
        </para>
        <para>
            The toolbox can be found at <emphasis>SCHEDULING/extensions/scilab/PAscheduler</emphasis>. To install it inside Scilab, the toolbox must be built and loaded inside Scilab via the standard Scilab toolboxes installation scheme.
            Below is the sequence of instructions from the scilab prompt to install it.
        </para>
        <para>At Scilab prompt, you first need to move to the toolbox root directory. Then you need to run "exec builder.sce", and "exec loader.sce" as shown underneath:</para>
