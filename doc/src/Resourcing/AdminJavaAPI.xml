	The ProActive Resource Manager can be used directly from the Java code through its Java API. This chapter explains
	how to do that, namely how to start and stop the resource manager, add existing nodes and deploy
	new nodes with GCM deployment descriptors.
	</para>

		<para>
			Resource Manager can be started locally using a static method of RMFactory class:
		</para>
		<programlisting language="java">
//create initializer for the resource manager.
//the 6 following lines are mandatory if starting RM in a clean JVM
//But each variable can be set as JVM argument (ie. -Dvar=value) instead of as API.
RMInitializer init = new RMInitializer();
init.setRMHomePath("/path/to/RM/home");
init.setLog4jConfiguration("/path/to/log4j");
init.setJavaSecurityPolicy("/path/to/securityPolicy");
init.setProActiveConfiguration("/path/to/PAconfigurationFile");
init.setResourceManagerPropertiesConfiguration("/path/to/RMPropertiesFile");

//start an empty RM...
System.out.println("Starting RM, please wait...");

RMAuthentication auth = RMFactory.startLocal(init);

//retreiving connection URL for RM : auth.getHostURL()
System.out.println("RM successfully started at : " + auth.getHostURL());

		</programlisting>
		<para>
		In order to perform any operations with the Resource Manager, you have to authorize and
		acquire ResourceManager interface. This action is made by using RMConnection class:
		</para>
		<programlisting language="java">
RMAuthentication auth = RMConnection.join("rmi://my_rm_host");
ResourceManager resourceManager = null;
try {
    // (1) preferred authentication method (getting credentials from the disk)
	resourceManager = auth.login(Credentials.getCredentials());
} catch (KeyException e) {
    try {
        // (2) valid authentication method (creating credentials on the fly)
        PublicKey pubKey = auth.getPublicKey();
        if (pubKey == null) {
             pubKey = Credentials.getPublicKey(Credentials.getPubKeyPath());
        }

        if (pubKey != null) {
		Credentials cred = Credentials.createCredentials("username", "password", pubKey);
		resourceManager = auth.login(cred);
        }
    } catch (KeyException ex) {
        // cannot retrieve the public key
    } catch (LoginException ex) {
		// incorrect user name or password
	}
} catch (LoginException e) {
	// incorrect user name or password
}</programlisting>
		<para>
		  Connecting to the resource manager implicates using a keypair infrastructure to establish a secure channel on
		  which the credentials (username and password) will be sent securely. There are three ways to connect
		  to the Resource Manager, as described in the example above:
		  <orderedlist>
		    <listitem><para>
			Retreive the Credentials from disk: supposes the script <emphasis>create-cred[.bat]</emphasis> was previously used to generate those credentials.
			It requires knowing the location of the public key corresponding to the private key that will be used for decryption on server side.
			To obtain the key, you need to contact the administrator of the Scheduler.
		      </para>
		      <para>
			<programlisting language="sh"><![CDATA[
# use local public key to generate credentials for user 'demo'
/bin/unix $ ./create-cred -P $HOME/.proactive/rm_pubkey -o $HOME/.proactive/my_encrypted_credentials -l demo
# use rmi://example.com/RMAUTHENTICATION's public key to generate credentials for user 'admin' with pass 'admin' in non-interactive mode
/bin/unix $ ./create-cred -U rmi://example.com/RMAUTHENTICATION -o $HOME/.proactive/my_encrypted_credentials -l admin -p admin
]]></programlisting>
			Credentials can now be retreived when properly designated by the <emphasis>pa.common.auth.credentials</emphasis> property; ie using
			<emphasis>java -Dpa.common.auth.credentials=$HOME/.proactive/my_encrypted_credentials</emphasis>.
		    </para></listitem>
		    <listitem><para>
			Create the encrypted Credentials on client side: as safe as the previous method, but requires user input, which prevents automation,
			or storing clear credentials on the disk, which can result to security breaches. This method also requires knowing the public key,
			which should be offered by the Resource Manager through the Authentication object with the getPubKey() method.
			If the Resource Manager doesn't know the public key, it can be stored locally on client side and designated by the
			<emphasis>pa.common.auth.pubkey</emphasis> Java property; ie using <emphasis>java -Dpa.common.auth.pubkey=$HOME/.proactive/pub.key</emphasis>.
		    </para></listitem>
		    <listitem><para>
			If you can not retrieve the public key, you can use the old deprecated API, which sends clear credentials on the network, and requires user input.
		    </para></listitem>
		  </orderedlist>
		</para>
		<para>
		Besides the ResourceManager interface you may also obtain RMMonitoring
		interface which can be used to track resources and their states.
		Once you have a reference to ResourceManager active object, you can perform all
		actions according to your role (permissions) such as shutdown of the Resource Manager
		</para>
		<programlisting language="java">
resourceManager.shutdown(true); //performs preemptive shutdown	</programlisting>
		<para>
		This method terminates all RM's active objects and stops JVM where RMCore is running. The boolean parameter that it takes in argument
		defines whether the Resource Manager stops immediately, even if there are some busy
		nodes (i.e. some nodes have been provided to an application) or waits while applications
		give them back.
		</para>

	<section xml:id="RM_API_add_node"><info><title>Register an existing node</title></info>
	<para>
	ResouceManager provides a way to add ProActive nodes that are already deployed. Nodes are added using
	their URLs.
	</para>
	<programlisting language="java">
resourceManager.addNode("rmi://host_1/comptingNode"); //adds a node identified with an URL
	</programlisting>
	</section>
	<section xml:id="RM_API_remove_node"><info><title>Remove a node from the resource manager</title></info>
	<para>
	You can remove a node from Resource Manager with the code:
	</para>
	<programlisting language="java">
resourceManager.removeNode("rmi://nodeToRemove", true);
	</programlisting>
	<para>
		The first parameter is the URL of the node to remove and the second one is a boolean.
		If this boolean is set to true, the resource manager removes immediately the node even if it is busy.
		If this boolean is set to false and the node is busy, the resource manager waits until
		the user occupied the node releases it. Once the node is released the RM removes it.
	</para>
	</section>
	<section xml:id="RM_API_custom_node_source"><info><title>Create a node source</title></info>
		<para>
		You can create different node sources using the ResourceManager interface.
		Let's take a look at the following example to know how to create one of them
		</para>
		<programlisting language="java">
// creating infrastructure manager parameters
Object[] imParameters = new Object[] { hostsList, GCMDeploymentData };
// creating policy parameters
Object[] policyParameters = new Object[] {
		   "ALL", // nodes availability scope
		   "USER", // administrators of this node source
           schedulerURL, // scheduler url
           username, // scheduler user name
           password, // scheduler user password
           "true", // preemptive removal
           "0", // min modes
           "1", // max modes
           "1", // nodes per task
           "1000" // releasing period
};
admin.createNodesource("Scheduler loading node source", GCMCustomisedInfrastructure.class.getName(), imParameters,
	SchedulerLoadingPolicy.class.getName(), policyParameters);
		</programlisting>
		<para>
		The node source is created with GCM customized infrastructure manager and scheduler loading policy.
		In order to create the infrastructure manager, host list and GCM deployment template files are preliminary loaded and their
		contents is transformed to byte arrays. Then, parameters of infrastructure manager and node source policy are defined and the
		<literal> admin.createNodesource(...)</literal> method is used to create new node sources. It is required that a scheduler is running somewhere at the
		moment of the node source creation.
		</para>
