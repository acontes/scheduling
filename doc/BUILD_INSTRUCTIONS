To build the manuals you will need the documentation 
toolchain in this folder.

The toolchain is available through anonymous svn at 

svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/proactive/documentation/trunk

for the current trunk version, and at 

svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/proactive/documentation/tags/current_release

for the current stable version. 


== SVN Users ==

To download the documentation toolchain go to the doc folder
and execute download_toolchain.bat.

The file will start the toolchain download by running:
svn export svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/proactive/documentation/tags/current_release toolchain


== GIT-SVN Users ==

To download the documentation toolchain go to the doc folder
and execute download_toolchain_git.


== Documentation Targets ==
After the download is finished the manual can be built from
the compile folder for the project using build with the following
targets:
