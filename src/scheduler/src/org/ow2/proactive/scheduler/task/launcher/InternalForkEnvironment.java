     * Create a new instance of InternalForkEnvironment using a fork environment and a base env.<br/>
     * This solution was the only one to decorate a fork environment according to those constraints :
     * <ul>
     * <li>ForkEnvironment type and API must be the same at user side and in the worker side (executed in the envscript)</li>
     * <li>No additional constructor is allowed in ForkEnvironment</li>
     * <li>We cannot use getter from ForkEnvironment as they don't match the real field type</li>
     * <li>It's not possible for the internal type and the user type to be in the same package as the internal type must be in internal package</li>
     * <li>We must "replay" user environment at worker side in the same order as he put it in ForkEnvironment at user side</li>
     * </ul>
     * <br/>
     * The goal of this class and constructor is just to have a way to create an object extending ForkEnvironment
     * and that is able to see protected field to re-set values. As it is not possible to see protected field
     * in a subclass out of the super class package, we create a protected constructor in the super class.<br/>
     * This class just use the superclass protected constructor.<br/>
     * <br/>
     * The result is an object extending ForkEnvironment, that represents the same object + a base env seen as the user ForkEnvironment<br/>
     * <br/>
     * Note : if baseEnv is null, an empty one is used.<br/>
