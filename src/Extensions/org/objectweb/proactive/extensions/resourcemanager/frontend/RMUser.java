/**
 * An interface Front-End for the Resource Manager's User active object.
 * Provides a way to perform user operations in Resource manager (RM).
 * We consider the ProActive scheduler as an 'user' of RM.
 * So the user (scheduler) launch tasks on nodes, it asks node to the RM.
 * and give back nodes at the end of the tasks. That the two operations
 * of an user :<BR>
 * - ask nodes (get nodes).<BR>
 * - give back nodes (free nodes).<BR><BR>
 *
 * Scheduler can ask nodes that verify criteria. selections criteria are
 * defined in a test script which provides kind of boolean result :
 * node suitable or not suitable.<BR>
 * This script is executed in the node before selecting it,
 * If the node match criteria, it is selected, otherwise RM tries the selection script
 * on other nodes.
