/**
 * 
 * <P>
 * Service is a utility class that provides many useful methods to serve requests.
 * It is usually instantiated once at the beginning of the runActivity() method of
 * an active object in order to be used for serving requests. For instance :
 * </P><P>
 * <pre>
 * public void runActivity(org.objectweb.proactive.Body body) {
 *   org.objectweb.proactive.Service service = new org.objectweb.proactive.Service(body);
 * ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * For instance the live method of the bounded buffer example :
 * <pre>
 *  public void runActivity(org.objectweb.proactive.Body body) {
 *    org.objectweb.proactive.Service service = new org.objectweb.proactive.Service(body);
 *    while (body.isActive()) {
 *      if (count == 0) {
 *        // if the buffer is empty
 *        service.blockingServeOldest("put"); // Serve the first buffer.put call
 *      } else if (count == size) {
 *        // if the buffer is full
 *        service.blockingServeOldest("get"); // Serve the first buffer.get call
 *      } else {
 *        // if the buffer is neither empty nor full
 *        service.blockingServeOldest(); // Serve the first buffer.xxx call
 *      }
 *    }
 *  }
 * </pre>
