 * A <code>Node</code> offers a set of services needed by ProActive to work with
 * remote JVM. Each JVM that is aimed to hold active objects should contains at least
 * one instance of the node class. That instance, when created, will be registered
 * to some registry where it is possible to perform a lookup (such as the RMI registry).
 * </p><p>
 * When ProActive needs to interact with a remote JVM, it will lookup for one node associated
 * with that JVM (using typically the RMI Registry) and use this node to perform the interaction.
 * </p><p>
 * We expect several concrete implementations of the Node to be wrtten such as a RMI node, a HTTP node ...
