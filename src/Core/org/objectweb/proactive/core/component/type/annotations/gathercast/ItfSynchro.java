/**
 * <p>Annotation for specifying timeouts and waitForAll mode at the level of interfaces.</p>
 * <p>Timeouts are only handled for invocations of methods that return a result.</b>
 * <p>When a timeout is detected, the default behavior is to throw a GathercastTimeoutException to the clients.</p>
 * <p>If waitForAll is set to true (default behaviour), the method will wait for the requests of all components binded on the gathercast interface before to be executed.</p>
 * <p>If waitForAll is set to false, the method will be executed immediately on the first request received (therefore will not wait for requests from other components binded on the gathercast interface).</p>
 * <p>Also, if waitForAll is set to false then it could not be combined with a timeout (throw an {@link org.objectweb.fractal.api.factory.InstantiationException}).</p>
