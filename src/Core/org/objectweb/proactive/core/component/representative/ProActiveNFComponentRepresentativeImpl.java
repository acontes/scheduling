/**
 * An object of type <code> Component  </code> which is a remote reference on a
 * component. <br>
 * When creating an active object of type <code> A  </code>, you get a reference
 * on the active object through a dynamically generated stub of type
 * <code> A  </code>. Similarly, when creating a component, you get a reference
 * on an object of type <code> Component  </code>, in other words an instance of
 * this class. Ini this case, this class represents a non functional component. It is marked by the ProActiveNFComponentRepresentative interface.
 * <p>
 * During the construction of an instance of this class, references to
 * interfaces of the component are also dynamically generated : references to
 * functional interfaces corresponding to the server interfaces of the
 * component, and references to control interfaces. The idea is to save remote
 * invocations : when requesting a controller or an interface, the generated
 * corresponding interface is directly returned. Then, invocations on this
 * interface are reified and transferred to the actual component. <br>
