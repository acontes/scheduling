/**

 * An object implementing this interface is an implementation of the non fonctionnal part
 * of an ActiveObject. This representation is local to the ActiveObject. By contrast there
 * is a remote representation of Body that can be accessed by distant object.
 * </P><P>
 * <code>UniversalBody</code> defines the remote accessible part of the body while
 * <code>LocalBody</code> defines the local accessible part of the body.
 * </P><P>
 * The body of an ActiveObject provides needed services such as a the ability to sent and
 * receive request and reply.
 * </P><P>
 * The interface also defines how the activity methods of an active object sees its Body.
 * </P><P>
 * A body has 2 associated states :
 * <ul>
 * <li>alive : the body is alive as long as it is processing request and reply</li>
 * <li>active : the body is active as long as it has an associated thread running
 *              to serve the requests by calling methods on the active object.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </P><P>
 * Note that a thread can be alive but not active, such as a forwarder that just
 * forward request to another peer.
