 * An object instance of this class is to be returned when a method of an active
 * object needs to be called synchronously. No real data is expected as a result,
 * but the caller needs to wait the actual execution (service) of the request.
 * Because the class is final, the reified call cannot return a future and will
 * do a synchronous call.
 * </P><P>
 * This type can be used instead of void to perform the synchronous call. Note that
 * any final object will result in the same behaviour.
