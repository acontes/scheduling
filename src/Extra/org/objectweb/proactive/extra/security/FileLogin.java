     * to use the <code>FileLoginModule</code> in this package. It will only
     * work if the file designated by path contains pairs in the form :
     * username1:password1<br>

     *            corresponding to the "inriaLocalLogin" in the directory, "pw"
     *            being the password, and "path" the path to the file with the
     *            pairs login/pw. It can also contain groups informations : a
     *            hierarchy of groups, a file that defines which user belongs to
     *            which group, and the lowest group required to successfully log
     *            in. The group required is the "group" entry, the group
     *            hierarchy is the entry "groupsHierarchy" and is a
     *            <code>String[]</code> starting by the group with the least
     *            rights, and the file is the "groupsFilePath" entry. The
     *            "groupsFilePath" and "groupsHierarchy" entries must be defined
     *            only if the "group" one is defined too.
     * @return always true
     * @throws LoginException
     *             If the authentication fails (incorrect credentials) or if
     *             there is an error during the attempt to verify them.
