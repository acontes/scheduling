For every machines that you will be using:

STEP 1: 

You have 3 options for installing Scilab and make it work with ProActive, if you are in a 64 bits architecture only the first option will work :

1) BINARY installation from Scilab 4.1.2:
If you're machine is a 32 bit Linux or Windows, download Scilab 4.1.2 or above BINARY Version
	
Important : The Scilab Java interface doesn't work properly in 64 bits mode. But you can still use it on a 64 bits-architecture in 32 bits-mode.
 
	In order to do that use the 4.1.2 BINARY version or compile a source version on a similar 32 bit similar OS distribution.

2) SOURCE installation from Scilab 4.1.2:
If you want to compile the library from a source version :

	Download Scilab 4.1.2 SOURCE Version.

	make binaries of Scilab (procedure is explained  in SCILAB/Readme_Linux or SCILAB/Readme_Windows)
	
	After the build, make sure that you find libjavasci.so or javasci.dll in the SCILAB/bin directory  

3) SOURCE installation from Scilab 4.1 or Scilab 4.1.1:
If you can't have access to Scilab 4.1.2 or want to use an earlier version, download Scilab SOURCE version 4.1 or 4.1.1 (lower versions are not supported)

copy javasci_Scilab2.h and javasci_Scilab2.c from folder c_sources to SCILAB/routines/Javasci/

make binaries of Scilab (procedure is explained  in SCILAB/Readme_Linux or SCILAB/Readme_Windows)

After the build, make sure that you find libjavasci.so or javasci.dll in the SCILAB/bin directory

STEP 2: 
After you install Scilab, you need to install it into your PATH.
 
In Windows systems, this will be done automatically by the Scilab installer. 

Under linux, wou will have to run the following command on the Scilab directory after STEP 1:

> make install
