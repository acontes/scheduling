!        Matlab interface to the ProActive Scheduler       !
!----------------------------------------------------------!

The Matlab interface to the ProActive Scheduler allows you to schedule Matlab scripts on a distributed environment using either:

1) job descriptors of the ProActive Scheduler
2) Directly from the Matlab envrionment

The interface is compatible with Matlab 7.1 (R14.3) and later.

You need to compile a native library called Ptolemy that will link against the native libraries of your Matlab installation.
A few percompiled libraries are bundled with the Scheduler

The scripts in this directory can be run on Linux or Cygwin(Windows)

In order to build the libraries, first set the MATLAB environment variable to the full path of your Matlab command.
Under Windows, this must point the the MATLAB.exe file in the MATLAB_ROOT/bin/win32 directory

Make sure that the "javac" command from a Java JDK (and not JRE) is accessible in the Path.

On Windows environment, it is mandatory to have both Cygwin and Mingw installed in order to build the library.

Under Cygwin you need to set the right Path and the MATLAB environment variable by System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables (don't define them directly under Cygwin using export MATLAB=...).

On the prompt, first move the the Scheduler/extensions/matlab directory and run:

> ./configure
> make

This will copy the Ptolemy library to the Scheduler/lib directory. Please note that this library depends on two things:
1) The Matlab version
2) Your architecture (Linux, 32 or 64 bit, Windows 32 or 64 bit, Sun Solaris, etc...)

The script has been tested only on Linux 32/64 bits and Windows 32bits. It's possible that problems appear on other architectures.

Therefore:
1) If you want to connect ProActive to another Matlab version you'll need to provide a MATLAB variable that will point to this other version and re-launch the scripts.
2) If you want to connect ProActive to a Matlab installed on a different architecture, you'll need to re-launch the scripts on this architecture.
