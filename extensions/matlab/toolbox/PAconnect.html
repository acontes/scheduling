<code><pre>  <b>PAconnect</b> connects to the ProActive scheduler
 
  Syntax
 
        <b>PAconnect</b>(url [,credpath]);
        jobs = <b>PAconnect</b>(url [,credpath]);
 
  Inputs
 
        url - url of the scheduler
        credpath - path to the login credential file
 
  Ouputs
 
        jobs - id of jobs that were not terminated at matlab's previous
        shutdown
 
  Description
 
        <b>PAconnect</b> connects to a running ProActive Scheduler by specifying its
        url. If the scheduler could be reached a popup window will appear, asking
        for login and password. An additional SSH key can also be provided when the user needs to execute remote task under one's identity (RunAsMe option). ProActive Scheduler features a full account
        management facility along with the possibility to synchronize to existing
        Windows or Linux accounts via LDAP.
        More information can be found inside Scheduler's manual chapter "Configure
        users authentication". If you haven't configured any account in the
        scheduler use, the default account login "demo", password "demo".
        You can as well encrypt credentials using the command line tool "create-cred" to automate the connection.
 
        <b>PAconnect</b> can also return the ids of PAsolve jobs that
        were still running at the end of the last Matlab session (Disconnected
        Mode). Results of these jobs can then be retrieved using
        PAgetResults.
 
  Example
 
    jobs = <b>PAconnect</b>('rmi://scheduler:1099')
