<code><pre>  <b>PAResult/PAwaitAny</b> blocks matlab execution until any result is available in a
  given array of PAResult object
 
  Syntax
        &gt;&gt; val = PAwaitAny(r)
        &gt;&gt; [val, index] = PAwaitAny(r)
  
  Inputs
 
    r - an array of PAResult objects received by a call to PAsolve
 
  Outputs
    
    val - contains the real result of the computation.
    index - contains the index of the result computed in the r array.
 
  Description
 
    <b>PAResult/PAwaitAny</b> will block matlab execution while waiting for a given set of
    results. <b>PAResult/PAwaitAny</b> differs from PAResult/PAwaitFor in that it will wait for the
    first result available and returns this result, allowing
    post-processing treatments to be executed immediately without having to
    wait for a large set of results. Further calls to PAwaitAny will return
    the remaining results until all results have been computed.
 
  Example
 
    &gt;&gt; r=PAsolve(@factorial, 1, 2, 3, 4);
    &gt;&gt; val = PAwaitAny(r)  % Blocks Matlab execution until either factorial(1), ..
    , or factorial(4) has been computed remotely and returns the result as
    val = factorial(i)
    &gt;&gt; val2 = PAwaitAny(r) % Blocks for the second result, etc ...
 
    r=PAsolve(@factorial, 1, 2, 3, 4);
    Job submitted : 24
    [val, index] = PAwaitAny(r)
    val =
       1
    index =
       1     1
    [val, index] = PAwaitAny(r)
    val =
       2
    index =
       1     2
    [val, index] = PAwaitAny(r)
    val =
       6
    index =
       1     3
    [val, index] = PAwaitAny(r)
    val =
      24
    index =
       1     4
